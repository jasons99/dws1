              The guitar is a popular musical instrument classified
              as a string instrument with anywhere from 4 to 18
              strings, usually having 6. The sound is projected
              either acoustically or through electrical
              amplification (for an acoustic guitar or an electric
              guitar, respectively). It is typically played by
              strumming or plucking the strings with the right hand
              while fretting (or pressing against the fret) the
              strings with the left hand. The guitar is a type of
              chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and
              strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and
              distinguished from other chordophones by its
              construction and tuning. The modern guitar was
              preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course
              Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque
              guitar, all of which contributed to the development
              of the modern six-string instrument.

              There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar:

              The classical guitar (nylon-string guitar), the
              steel-string acoustic guitar, and the archtop guitar.
              The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the
              strings' vibration, amplified by the body of the
              guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The
              classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument
              using a comprehensive fingerpicking technique. The
              term fingerpicking can also refer to a specific
              tradition of certian types of music. Many styles of
              music are played on the guitar, such as:

                    The Electric Guitar
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Electric guitars,</strong> introduced
                    in the 1930s, use an amplifier that can
                    electronically manipulate and shape the tone.
                    Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body,
                    but a solid body was eventually found more
                    suitable, as it was less prone to feedback.
                    Electric guitars have had a continuing profound
                    influence on popular culture. The guitar is
                    used in a wide variety of musical genres
                    worldwide. It is recognized as a primary
                    instrument in genres such as blues, bluegrass,
                    country, flamenco, folk, jazz, jota, mariachi,
                    metal, punk, reggae, rock, soul, and many forms
                    of pop.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Acoustic guitars</strong> form several
                    notable subcategories within the acoustic
                    guitar group: classical and flamenco guitars;
                    steel-string guitars, which include the
                    flat-topped, or "folk," guitar; twelve-string
                    guitars; and the arched-top guitar. The
                    acoustic guitar group also includes unamplified
                    guitars designed to play in different
                    registers, such as the acoustic bass guitar,
                    which has a similar tuning to that of the
                    electric bass guitar.
